# Age_and_Gender_Detection_Prediction
This project implements a deep learning model to predict the age and gender of individuals from facial images. The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and is trained on a dataset of labeled images. The key objectives of the project are:

--> Age Prediction: Estimating the approximate age range of a person based on their facial features.

--> Gender Classification: Classifying the gender (male or female) of a person from their face.
# Features:
--> Preprocessing: The facial images are preprocessed to standardize input data for the model.

--> CNN Architecture: A custom CNN model is designed and trained to extract features relevant to age and gender prediction.

--> Training: The model is trained on a labeled dataset with diverse age groups and gender representations.

--> Prediction: The trained model can predict the age range and gender of individuals in real-time or from static images.

--> Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, mean absolute error (MAE) for age prediction, and F1-score for gender classification.
# Technologies Used:
